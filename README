merb_upload
===========

This plugin for Merb provides a simple and extremely flexible way to upload files. Here's how:

1 Add it as a dependency to your config/init.rb
    
    dependency 'merb_upload'

2 Generate an uploader

    merb-gen uploader avatar
    
  You'll have an uploader now in app/uploaders/avatar_uploader.rb.
  
3 Upload stuff

    uploader = AvatarUploader.new('myfile.png')
    
    uploader.cache!( File.open('/path/to/my/file.rb') )
    
    uploader.store!
    
  or shorter:
  
    AvatarUploader.store!('myfile.png', '/path/to/my/file.rb')
    
  you can retrieve files by the identifier (the first argument)
  
    uploader = AvatarUploader.retrieve_from_store!
